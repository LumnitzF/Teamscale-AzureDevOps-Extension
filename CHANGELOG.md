We use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/):

- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
- PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

# Next Release

- [feature] upload task: set sensible default file pattern that works for the `DotNetCoreCLI` pipeline task

# 1.3.2
- [fix] work item integration: the test gap badge for work items was sometimes different from the badge shown in the Teamscale issue perspective

# 1.3.0

- [feature] upload task: use the [teamscale-upload](https://github.com/cqse/teamscale-upload) tool instead of curl for better certificate and error handling

# 1.2.7

This and previous versions had no CHANGELOG yet.
